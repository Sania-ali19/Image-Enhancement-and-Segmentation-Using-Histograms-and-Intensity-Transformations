Histogram and Intensity Transformations
Objectives:
In this task, we perform pixel-level transformations to optimize the visual characteristics of images. The process involves creating histograms to analyze pixel intensity distribution, applying intensity transformations to enhance the contrast and brightness of images, and using thresholding techniques for simple segmentation. These steps make objects in images easier to detect and highlight, improving the overall image quality for further analysis.

Tools Used:
Python: The programming language used for implementing image processing techniques.
OpenCV: A popular open-source library for computer vision tasks. It provides the necessary functions for reading images, transforming pixel intensities, creating histograms, and applying thresholding techniques.
Matplotlib: Used for visualizing the histograms and the output of different image transformations.
NumPy: For handling image arrays and performing pixel-level operations.
Key Concepts:
Pixel Transforms: Pixel transforms are applied to each pixel in the image independently, allowing us to adjust pixel intensities and enhance the visibility of key features in the image.

Histograms: A histogram is created to represent the distribution of pixel intensities within an image. This helps us analyze the contrast and brightness of the image and determine if any enhancement is necessary.

Steps:
Use OpenCV to calculate the histogram of the image.
Use Matplotlib to visualize the histogram.
Intensity Transformations: These transformations help adjust image brightness and contrast, making certain objects in the image easier to identify.

Types of Transformations:

Linear Transformations: Adjust contrast and brightness.
Log Transformations: Enhance low-intensity details.
Gamma Correction: Adjust brightness in a non-linear way to simulate different lighting conditions.
Steps:

Apply transformation functions to the pixel intensities using OpenCV and NumPy.
Display the transformed image and its histogram for comparison.
Thresholding and Simple Segmentation: Thresholding is used to segment an image by converting grayscale images into binary ones. Pixels above a certain intensity are set to white, while those below are set to black.

Steps:
Apply a threshold to the image using OpenCV’s threshold() function.
Visualize the segmented image to observe how objects are isolated from the background.
Example Workflow:
Load the image using OpenCV.
Create and visualize the image’s histogram.
Apply intensity transformations to adjust contrast and brightness.
Use thresholding to perform segmentation and isolate objects of interest.
Visualize the final processed images and histograms using Matplotlib.
By following this workflow, we can optimize image characteristics and segment regions of interest effectively.
